The AI engineer successfully established an MVP of an order management system, , demonstrating core functionalities including authentication, dashboard, order management, cooking status tracking, customer self-service, pricing, and an order queue. The subsequent development phase focused heavily on frontend UI/UX, driven by user feedback. This included a comprehensive redesign for a professional look, transitioning the order queue from scrolling to static pagination, optimizing the Kitchen Display System to show multiple orders efficiently, and implementing mobile responsiveness. Key challenges involved debugging UI state inconsistencies (e.g., status value mismatches) and iteratively refining visual elements like colors and component layouts to meet subjective user preferences for aesthetic and information density, often requiring immediate reverts. The latest tasks involve backend data management and menu updates.

The user initially provided an operational  order management system. Key existing features include:
*   **Authentication System**: Admin login functionality.
*   **Dashboard**: Displays order statistics (pending, completed, total).
*   **Order Management**: Tabs for Pending Orders, Completed Orders, View Orders, with New Order, Refresh, and search functionalities.
*   **Enhanced Cooking Status Management**: Individual item status tracking (not started -> cooking -> finished), automatic order completion, real-time updates.
*   **Customer Self-Service**: MyOrder page (no auth required), phone number lookup, sequential order numbering.
*   **Comprehensive Pricing System**: Automatic calculations, item/subtotal pricing, Excel export.
*   **Order Queue Screen (Kitchen Display System)**: Dedicated page with initial scrolling animation, later changed to static with pagination.

Subsequent explicit user requests were:
*   **UI Redesign**: Professional, outclassed, intriguing UI with smooth animations, using restaurant industry terminology, while retaining all existing features.
*   **Order Queue/Kitchen Display System (KDS) Modifications**:
    *   Initial: Static display, locked, no rollover, showing 10 orders at a time.
    *   Further: Display *all* 10 orders simultaneously (not one by one), with compact tiles.
    *   Later: Remove status update functionality from KDS, make tiles smaller to fit 3 rows with up to 20 orders, showing 5 item list.
    *   Final: Squeeze KDS item status list inside tiles (prevent leaking), make colors True Tone rich and daylight-visible.
*   **Kitchen Board Tab (Service Station) Status Update**: Ensure item status can be updated from this tab.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: Make the entire UI mobile-friendly.
*   **Remove Demo Credentials**: Eliminate demo login information from the login page.
*   **Service Station/Pending Orders Display**:
    *   Initially, revert previous compact tile changes due to user dissatisfaction, ensuring buttons/info are locked and visible.
    *   Later: Display item status list *below* the existing status badge (vertically stacked) instead of to the side in landscape/iPad mode.
    *   Later: Ensure pending order tiles are industry standard with zero leaks (no content outside tile) on any screen size.
    *   Finally, revert the industry standard change due to user dissatisfaction, returning to the previous good layout.
*   **Reports Screen**: All table column labels should be black.
*   **Terminology Update**: Change cooking status to In Process system-wide.
*   **Menu/Database Update**: Remove 'chef' and 'sousChef' fields from menu, update categories and items with prices as per an implied image/spec.
*   **Database Cleanup**: Clean the database to start with zero records.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with cleaning the database to start with zero records. This followed a series of UI/UX refinements and data structure updates. The previous major work involved:
1.  **Menu and Data Model Updates**: The  and  fields were removed from the backend  model () and corresponding service logic (). The menu categories and items themselves were also updated as per an implied user specification. Frontend components (, ) were also modified to remove  references.
2.  **UI Layout Reversion**: After a user complaint about the industry standard tile design being worse, the AI engineer successfully reverted the  and related layout changes to the previous good design. The only changes retained from that iteration were the shift of the item status list to the bottom of the card and the In Process terminology.
3.  **Terminology Consistency**: The term 'cooking' for item status was universally replaced with 'In Process' across , , and .
4.  **Reports Screen Styling**: All table column headers in  were set to .

The application's UI is now back to a previously approved good design for pending orders, with specific adjustments like vertical item status lists and black table headers. The Kitchen Display System remains highly configurable for showing 20 orders in a compact, read-only view with rich colors. The backend menu models and services have been updated to reflect new menu structure without chef/sous chef data. The immediate next step is database manipulation.
