<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed an order management application from scratch and progressively added features based on user requests. The development followed a full-stack approach, modifying both backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend (React, Tailwind CSS). Key architectural decisions included using Pydantic for models, separate services for business logic, and clear API contracts. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in understanding and implementing complex features incrementally, including order numbering, cooking status, pricing, and UI enhancements. The work was systematically tested, with thorough backend and frontend validations. The engineer always confirmed functionality before proceeding and adapted to user-specified changes, such as making phone numbers optional and changing order numbering from complex to sequential. The current work focuses on integrating price analysis into the frontend reports page with an export functionality, indicating a continuous development cycle driven by user feedback.

The initial problem was to create a basic order management system. The application has evolved to support a comprehensive food ordering and management workflow.
Features implemented so far include:
- **Order Creation & Tracking**: Customers can place orders, and staff can manage them.
- **Phone Number Integration (initially mandatory, now optional)**: Orders can include a customer phone number, which was later made optional.
- **Customer Order Lookup**: A public  page allows customers to view their order details. Initially by phone number, now by a unique, sequential order number (e.g., #1, #2).
- **Pricing System**: Menu items have associated prices, and the system automatically calculates item subtotals and total order amounts. No tax calculations are included.
- **Cooking Status Tracking**: Individual items within an order have a  (not started, cooking, finished). Staff can update these statuses.
- **Automatic Order Completion**: If all items in an order are marked as 'finished', the entire order is automatically marked as 'completed' and delivered.
- **Enhanced Order Views**:
    - **Order Card**: Displays order number, customer name, items with quantities, prices, subtotals, and total amount.
    - **View Orders Tab (in Order Manager)**: Previously itemized, now displays orders grouped by food category with sub-lists of items, allowing individual item status changes.
- **Payment Method Placement**: The payment method selection in the order form was moved to appear just before order submission for better UX.
- **System Rebranding**: The application title was changed from Order Management to Mem Famous Stall 2025.
- **Real-time Notifications**: When items are added to an existing order, notifications appear on the top right, dismissible by clicking 'X'.
- **Price Analysis Reports**: A backend API () provides comprehensive data for item-wise revenue, quantity sold, and order counts. The user requested this to be integrated into a frontend  page with an Excel export option.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Data Modeling**: Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints, proper routing, and request/response handling.
- **State Management**: React's  and  hooks.
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI components.
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations with MongoDB, including atomic counters for sequential order numbers.
- **Environment Variables**: Strict adherence to using  for configuration (e.g., , ).

<pending_tasks>
- Frontend testing for Mem Famous Stall 2025 branding, category-based order view, notification system, and enhanced order cards. This was proposed by the AI engineer but superseded by a new user request.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate task being worked on is the integration of the price analysis functionality into the frontend's  page and adding an Excel export button for this data.
The backend API () is already implemented and tested, providing comprehensive item-wise revenue, quantity sold, and order counts.
The AI engineer has begun implementing the frontend changes for this. The current action in the trajectory shows the engineer reading  to understand its structure, likely to modify it to fetch and display the price analysis data.
The goal is to present the price analysis information on this page and provide a button that allows users to export this detailed report to an Excel sheet. The user emphasized completing this task quickly.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the price analysis data into the  component and implement the Excel export functionality as requested.
